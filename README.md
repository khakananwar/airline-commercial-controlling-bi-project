# Airline Commercial Controlling & BI Project
**Overview**
This project analyzes airline route profitability using commercial controlling principles and scenario-based network analysis. The analysis combines Python financial modeling with Power BI executive dashboards to evaluate operational performance and strategic decisions.

**Objectives**
* Evaluate route-level profitability.
* Compare short-, medium-, and long-haul economics.
* Assess sensitivity to:

  * Fuel price changes.
  * Load factor improvements.
  * Ancillary revenue growth.

* Provide executive-ready insights for network planning.

## Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Power BI.
* Commercial Airline KPI Framework.
* Scenario Financial Modeling.

## Key Insights

* Load factor improvements delivered the largest margin uplift.
* Fuel price reduction improved margins but did not resolve long-haul losses.
* Ancillary revenue provided incremental profitability support.
* Short- and medium-haul routes acted as network margin stabilizers.
